# HEGL Praktikum: Rejection Sampling in the Poincare disc

This is code produced during the [HEGL](https://hegl.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de) praktikum on Rejection Sampling in the Poincaré Disc. The sampling is based off of the Normal law defined in [Pennec's 2006 paper](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00614994/document).

Here is a brief description of the directory structure: 

- `Video/` contains a small animation of geodesics in the Poincaré disc. It is created with `Manim`, [community version](https://github.com/manimCommunity/manim). Acknowledgement: [This wonderful video on the 7-Circle Theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9v0h2ibYpo).
- `geodesics.py`: A script for generation of the illustration of geodesics on the Poincaré disc. Created with the `geoopt` Python library. Acknowledgement: The [`geoopt` readthedocs](https://geoopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extended/stereographic.html).
